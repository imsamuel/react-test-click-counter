# Reflection

## In this section, we...
- Set up a (very) simple React app with Jest and Enzyme
- Used Enzyme's `shallow` function to render a component
- Tested that required DOM elements were rendered using `find()`
- Tested state using Enzyme's `setState()` and `state()`
- Used `simulate` to interact with rendered elements and (clicked button)
- Tested component for updates after interaction.
- Created re-usable `setup()` and `findByTestAttr()` functions.
